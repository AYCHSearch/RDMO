Development server
------------------

Django comes with an integrated development server. It can be started using:

.. code:: bash

    python manage.py runserver

Then, RDMO is available on http://localhost:8000 in your (local) browser. The development server is **not** suited to serve the application to the internet. Hosting RDMO on an actual webserver is covered below.
