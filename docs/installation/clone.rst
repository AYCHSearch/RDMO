Obtaining the code
------------------

RDMO is hosted on github.com. Once ypou have  ``git`` installed, clone the current master branch using:

.. code:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/rdmorganiser/rdmo


We use `Semantic Versioning <http://semver.org>`_ for RDMO and you can find a list of all our releases on https://github.com/rdmorganiser/rdmo/releases. To checkout a particular release, change to the cloned directory and run:

.. code:: bash

    git checkout tags/VERSION

where VERSION stands for the particular version, e.g. ``v0.4.0``.
